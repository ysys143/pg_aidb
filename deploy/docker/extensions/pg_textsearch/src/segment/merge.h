/*
 * Merge all segments at the specified level into a single segment

 *
 * This performs an N-way merge of all segments in the level's chain:
 * 1. Opens all segment readers for the level
 * 2. Merges term dictionaries using linear scan (O(n) per term)
 * 3. Combines posting lists for duplicate terms
 * 4. Writes merged segment at the next level
 * 5. Updates metapage to reflect the new structure
 *
 * Parameters:
 *   index - The index relation (must be opened with appropriate lock)
 *   level - The level to merge (0 = L0, 1 = L1, etc.)
 *
 * Returns:
 *   The root block of the new merged segment, or InvalidBlockNumber
 * on failure.
 *
 * Note: The caller is responsible for holding an appropriate lock on
 * the index relation. This function modifies the metapage to update
 * level chains.
